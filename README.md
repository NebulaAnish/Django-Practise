# Django-Practise

Here are basic projects that I've made in the process of learning Django. I'll be uploading more into the repo as I progress.

## Project 1: Airlines project
steps to run:
  - clone the repo in your local device
  - navigate to the folder containing manage.py for particular project
  - $ python manage.py runserver
  - navigate to localhost:8000/flights to find the actual app
