# Django-Practise

Here are basic projects that I've made in the process of learning Django. I'll be uploading more into the repo as I progress.

## Project 1: Airlines project
Description: It is a simple app that helps keep records of passengers in a particular flight. It shows info of a single flight like it's flight route, names of passengers and time. Also it lists all the plane routes that are assigned to a single passenger. The frontend is trash.
steps to run:
  - clone the repo in your local device
  - navigate to the folder containing manage.py for particular project
  - $ python manage.py runserver
  - navigate to localhost:8000/flights to find the actual app
